## What is Raymon?
[Raymon.ai](http://raymon.ai) is an observability platform for ML-based systems that requires minimal setup. It allows you to monitor data quality and model performance over multiple slices of your data, it alerts you when something is wrong and provides you with troubleshooting tooling for further analysis. It is very extensible and it can serve for all data and model types.

Raymon's functionality includes:

- Making all model predictions and their pre- and postprocessing steps traceable.
- Validating incoming data and guarding for data drift or data health issues.
- Monitoring your model performance
- Benchmarking different slices of your production data against each other to expose slices with reduced performance.
- Alerting when things break down
- Fetching production data for further debugging
- Exporting valuable data from production for building high-quality datasets and improving your models

This repository contains the Raymon client library used for data profiling and logging that can be used standalone. It further contains the docs and serves as access point for any issues users might have.

## At a glance

### Installation

```bash
pip install raymon
```

### Logging text, data and tags

Raymon allows you to easily make model predictions traceable by enabling you to log text, data and tags.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

import raymon.types as rt
from raymon import Trace, RaymonAPILogger, Tag


logger = RaymonAPILogger(project_id=project_id)
trace = Trace(logger=logger, trace_id=None)

# Logging text messages
trace.info("You can log whatever you want here")

# Tagging traces
trace.tag([
        Tag(name="sdk_version", value="1.4.2", type="label"),
        Tag(name="prediction_time_ms", value="120", type="metric")
    ])

# Logging data
img = Image.open("./data_sample/castinginspection/def_front/cast_def_0_0.jpeg")
df = pd.DataFrame(arr, columns=['a', 'b'])

trace.log(ref="pandas-ref", data=rt.DataFrame(df))
trace.log(ref="image-ref", data=rt.Image(img))

```
### Building a model profile
Building a `ModelProfile` captures your expected (input, output and more) data characteristics...

```python
from raymon.profiling.extractors.structured import generate_components

all_data = pd.DataFrame(...)

profile = ModelProfile(
    name="houses_cheap", 
    version="0.0.1", 
    components=generate_components(all_data.dtypes),
    )

```

### Validating production data
... that can then be used in production code to validate your incoming data and model performance monitoring.

```python
profile.validate_input(row)
profile.validate_outputs(prediction)

```
