# Introducing Raymon

## What is Raymon?

**Raymon helps Machine Learning teams analyse data, data health and model performance in production.** Users can extract features describing data quality, data novelty, model confidence and prediction performance from data. Then, they can use these features to validate production data and monitor for data drift, data degradation and model degradation.

**The Raymon library is open source and can be used standalone** but integrates nicely with the rest of the Raymon.ai ML Observability hub, for example to make predictions [traceable and debuggable](using-the-raymon-hub/untitled.md).

**Raymonâ€™s focus is on simplicity and extendability**.&#x20;

**We can support any data type**. Currently, we offer extractors for structured data and vision data, but these can easily be extended which means we can support any data type.
