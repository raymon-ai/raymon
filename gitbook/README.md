# Intro & Installation

![Raymon: analyse data &amp; model health](.gitbook/assets/image.png)

## What?

Raymon helps Machine Learning teams analyse data, data health and model performance. Using data profiles, users can extract features describing data quality, data novelty, model confidence and prediction performance from data and use these features to validate production data and monitor for changes in data distributions, data health or model performance. 

Raymon is open source and can be used standalone but integrates nicely with the rest of the Raymon.ai ML Observability hub, for example to make models traceable and debuggable \(link to tracing docs\).  


Raymonâ€™s focus is on extractors that are cheap to compute and simple to understand. Currently, we offer extractors for structured data and vision data, but by implementing the right feature extractors we support any data type. Let us know if you would like to explore this!



## Installation

You can install the open source Python client library from pip.

```text
pip install raymon
```

  
The library can be used standalone, but integrates nicely with the rest of the Raymon.ai platform. See [https://raymon.ai](https://raymon.ai) for more info.
