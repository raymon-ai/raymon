# Intro: vision walkthrough

To get you started with Rayon, this walkthrough gives a complete overview of the required steps to get started with Raymon. This walkthrough uses the use case of a simplified computer vision project (with a mocked out model).

The code and data for this walkthrough can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/raymon-ai/raymon-demos/tree/master/retinopathy). You can go ahead and clone the repo to your local machine. Since it includes data, it can be rather big. For this use case, you'll use the contents of the `retinopathy` directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:raymon-ai/raymon-demos.git
cd raymon-demos/retinopathy
```

Next, you should install the demo (in editable mode) and its requirements:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Installing in editable mode will make sure you can easily change the code during this walkthrough.

## What's next?

The walkthrough contains the following steps:

* Introducing the existing use case
* Creating a model profile
* Creating a Raymon project
* Integrating raymon in your deployment
* Using the Raymon UI
